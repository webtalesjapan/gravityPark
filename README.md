##Steps to start
 * Make sure you have Node.js installed.
 * Clone the repo and go to the repo folder in a terminal of your choice
 * Install all node modules by using 
   ```
   npm install
   ```
 * Run the build server using
   ````
   npm run build-dev
   ````
  * Keep the previous terminal running; Open another terminal, go to the repo folder and run the node webserver using
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
    This would start a webserver on port 3000. 
    
  * Open localhost:3000/yourPath.
